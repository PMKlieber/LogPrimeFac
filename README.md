This is a quick program I wrote to graphically investigate some properties of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic under log-space. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also known as the unique prime factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers. For a couple examples: 46=2*23, 438=2*3*73, 602=2*7*43, 847=7*11*11. What's interesting about putting it in log space, is that the multiplication turns into addition, as in, log(46)=log(2)+log(23), log(438)=log(2)+log(3)+log(73), log(602)=log(2)+log(7)+log(43), log(847)=log(7)+log(11)+log(11), and this addition is much easier to graphically represent than multiplicaton (which would essentially need n dimensions for each of n factors).
